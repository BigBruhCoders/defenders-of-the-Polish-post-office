  "about": "We are the students of the \"Zespół Szkół Łączności im. Obrońców Poczty Polskiej\" in Gdansk.  We prepared the website for the competition: \"Śladami Obrońców Poczty Polskiej w Gdańsku\". Fascinated by the first competition, we decided to take part in the second edition. The topic of the defence of the Polish Post Office is an interesting and important event for us. The project took us a total of 2 weeks to complete. Translated into English using #LINK# (free version). Link to source code:"
